ðŸ‘‹ When I chosen to become a programmer a couple of years ago, the prospect of lifelong learning was one of the main motivating factors. I enjoy learning new things and keep me update with the world. This makes me feel more comfortable and confident.

So I created this personal blog to share what I'm learning, document my coding journey, and explore topics such as frontend & backend development, as well as anything else that sparks my curiosity. I believe that writing is one of the best ways to learn and grow as a developer. It also improves my English skills - use it or lose it! Of course I choose to use them and take control of them. 

Whether you're also learning to code too or are just curious, I hope you find something helpful, interesting or inspiring here. ðŸ¤–
